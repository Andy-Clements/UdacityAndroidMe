# UdacityAndroidMe

Repository to track my progress through the AndroidMe exercise portion of the Advanced Android Development course on Udacity by Google. Each zip file contains the exercise worked through from Udacity and can be unzipped and imported as a project into Android Studio Arctic Fox 20203.1 using Android SDK 31
